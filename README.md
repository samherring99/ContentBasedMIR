# ContentBasedMIR

The science of Music Information Retrieval is a relatively new field within machine learning and data processing. The idea behind this project is to create a system that can compare content similarity of music to construct a better music recommendation algorithm for an upciming streaming app.

The newfeatures.py file holds the Spotify API access, where in the command line arguments songs and artists can be searched to download track analysis data for that artist's top 25 songs.

The plot_similarities.py takes the downloaded Spotify track data from a local CSV file and displays a table comparing the 54 audio elements extracted from a given song against all other songs, representing in color how similar or different they are.

Example:

IMPORTANT:

This project is in EARLY stages of development, as I need more resources and personell to finish it, but improvements will be made regularly. Feel free to use Github or contact me by email at samherring99@gmai.com eith any questions! Happy coding!
